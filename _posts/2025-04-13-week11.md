## Overview
Contributions ongoing

<!--more-->
We are still contributing to the OpenFoodFacts mobile app. The changes I made to my last PR last week, along with the suggestion I made, have not been interacted with by the core contributors. I'm looking at other issues. I did attempt to claim issue #6274, but it appears to be have been incorporated into a project for one of the OpenFoodFacts Google Summer of Code teams, and so I've requested issue #4662. This issue is labeled with "fixed?", but the bug shown in the description is still present.

It's been surprisingly slow going, since trying to take on more than one issue at a time appears to be frowned upon (other contributors were scolded for it), and it would be unreasonable to expect responses to questions and requests immediately, so we try to wait a bit before following up.
