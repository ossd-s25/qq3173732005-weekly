## Overview
Contributions ongoing

I did not submit the drawings. Further inspection showed that I didn't need to, as it was all mocked up already by the core contributors. I stated that I would implement the features that I'd discussed with the contributors, and asked if there was a different issue I could link, since the scope has expanded significantly beyond the original issue.
