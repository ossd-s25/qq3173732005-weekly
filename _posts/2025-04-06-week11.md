## Overview
Contributions ongoing + Shivam's presentation

<!--more-->
We have continued to contribute to OpenFoodFacts. Some changes were requested on my last PR, so I made those changes, but I'm not sure if it will be merged because the reviewer has raised the question of the possible infinite loop that the button creates in the app flow. They seem to be questioning this in terms of the original issue, so I don't know if I will be asked to make another change regarding this - I made a suggestions on what I might change to solve this problem - or if the issue will be closed altogether.

Any has had one PR merged and is requesting to be assigned to another issue, which is not labeled "Good first issues", so we will probably work together on it.

Shivam Balikondwar presented to our class on Wednesday. There was a lot of interesting info there, and I felt very inspired by his tenacity in making his first contribution despite being very out of his depth. I've felt that way often, and it's encouraging to get reinforcement that it's possible to push through.
