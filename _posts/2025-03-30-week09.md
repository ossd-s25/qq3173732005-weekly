My team has been contributing to OpenFoodFacts. I recently submitted a pull request that added a small feature to the app, which is now awaiting review. This was fun, both because I haven't done much mobile development before, and also because the Flutter framework is really very nice to work with. It's a bit of a chore to search for specific widgets in a big codebase that I wasn't involved in creating, but it was good practice. Hopefully the comment that accompanied the pull request was up to par as well. Most teams I've worked with have been small enough not to warrant this level of detail, so this was also a bit different.
